# resPYte
Ha, rest -> respite but in python resPYte .. ha..

# WHY
haven't you ever thought "Hey I'd like a Postman like client, but I really really really don't wanna install node because like... why should I? also I don't need a GUI I have a terminal!"?

.. no? Oh well, I have.


# What is it?
super basic TUI for testing REST endpoint. Literally built it in like .. an hour.. I might have spent more time on the name.. (probably bugs)

anywho..
`pip install respyte`

# Authorization
if your endpoint needs some generated on the fly string; create a python file with the logic, in your request headers for 'Authorization' pass the value of the filename and function seperated like a dot (import string)

# Color schemes
I'm just using asciimatics built in colorschemes
